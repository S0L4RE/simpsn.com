title: Internet Explorer sucks. Really bad.

I don't really think this is ground-breaking news here.

Safari, Firefox, Opera heck even OmniWeb; I'll take these over IE any day of the week. After reading some reports on the upcoming release of IE7, I'm skeptical that all of the needs will be met by the folks at Microsoft. Serious flaws such as consistent styling support and page rendering have plagued the browser, and as a designer, I would love to see CSS support done properly. Done even half-way right, it would be an improvement.

This would mean less fighting and more loving. As much as one can love Micro$oft that is.
