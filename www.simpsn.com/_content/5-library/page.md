You won’t find any novels here. The books I list here are the ones that got me to where I am, the ones with practical, actionable advice and things to learn. Those that don’t give you the instructions on design/development will inspire you to be better at your work. These people know what they’re talking about.

 

## Design

### [The Shape of Design](http://shapeofdesignbook.com/)

Frank Chimero is a true design genius — this is clear from his writings and talks at NAconf, Build, and the Do Lectures, as well as his book “The Shape Of Design”. Frank manages to communicate all his thoughts and ideas in a way that is both entertaining and enlightening. It’s hard to pinpoint one takeaway from this book — you just have to read it.

### [The Design of Everyday Things (Revised)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465050654/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i02?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

Khoi Vinh’s book gives a straight to-the-point overview of how to make grid systems that work in web design. I’ve used the book as my trusted guide for three websites now, all of them resulting in beautifully designed and futureproof grid systems. A must read.

 

## Development

### [Ordering Disorder: Grid Principles](http://www.amazon.com/Ordering-Disorder-Principles-Design-Voices/dp/0321703537/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1395777717&sr=1-1&keywords=ordering+disorder)
