### I'm not one to post videos to my blog often, but this recently published video from the legendary designer Hartmut Esslinger was quite intriguing.

<div class="videoWrapper"><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/59679411?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0&color=46bd00" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>

He starts the video with his thoughts dating back to 1982, when he felt there was a serious lack of a design scene in the US. This past weekend he finished his new book, Design Forward: Creative Strategies for Sustainable Change, and this short teaser video does a good job previewing his five design lessons (occasionally delivered with colorful language) learned on the job. There are many things he said that caught my attention, but his last point about going above and beyond was one of my favorites:

> "I think you should always do more than people ask for. Or we should not only look at what they ask for, but what they would like to do if they would have the courage to ask for it."

### His 5 key design lessons:

1. Trust yourself
2. Form follows emotion
3. Make models
4. Think outside the screen
5. Go above and beyond

I'll be honest, i'm really looking forward to picking up a copy of the book to dive deeper into each lesson. There is no doubt with his extensive career experience he'll have plenty of engaging content.

You can pre-order the book from Amazon here: [http://d.simp.sn/XDnuJot](http://d.simp.sn/XDnuJo)
