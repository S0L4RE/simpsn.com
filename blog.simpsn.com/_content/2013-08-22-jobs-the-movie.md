### So many people have been looking forward to the release of "Jobs" for a look into the life of Steve and the legacy he built at Apple, but did they deliver his story in just two hours?

The movie starts off with a dramatic cinematic view of an Apple presention with Jobs about to show the Apple team the first iPod to ever be released. When I first heard about the movie I was pretty skeptical about Kutcher being selected to portray the most influencial figures in technology of all time. That being said, I have to give him credit, he clearly did his homework. There is no doubt he spent a great deal of time[ learning Jobs’ mannerisms](http://mashable.com/2013/07/25/ashton-kutcher-steve-jobs-2/) and listening to video and audio files of Jobs’ speeches to mimic how he talked.

Now that is all fine and great, but unfortunately the movie itself wasn't all that accurate to the life of Steve. The writers only focused on the highest peaks, and the lowest lows and nothing in the middle. The problem for me is, in the middle shows a lot more of the everyday ways of how he ticked.There is no question that he was a creative genius, just as much so a corporate shark, but what made Steve tick to become who he was in the end. As an entrepreneur and absolute fanatic that became over obcessed with the quality of the Apple product he leaves a legacy of passion and dedication. On the front of being a co-worker, friend, and even father is a different story.

In the end the movie comes up pretty short telling us about the human side of Steve. A particularly bothersome example of this for me was after the initial conversation with his ex-girlfriend about being pregnant. A short time later we see the relationship between him and his daughter begin as estrangement with very little explanation. Before you know it, it’s clear that there has been a reconciliation of some kind but the connective tissue is completely missing. It would be nice to see how Jobs and his daughter repaired their relationship.

I'm looking forward to see trailers of another Job's movie that will be written by Aaron Sorkin. Perhaps he will capture more of the human elements behind Steve and portray the story a bit more accurately.

At the end of the day, the film left me wondering about how he handled his friendships with those closest to him and were an integral part of how he got to where he did. He was nothing less than cutthroat on his path to build Apple to what it is today, however, would it have been possible for him to do it without hurting so many along the way?
