When the release date of the first iPhone was announced last year, there was no question what I would be doing on June 29th. I was so excited about the iPhone that I couldn't even wait for it to hit stores, I preordered online. Fast forward to this year and the announcement of the release of the [iPhone 3G](http://www.apple.com/iphone/) and [2.0 software update](http://www.apple.com/iphone/softwareupdate/), there was no way that I wouldn't be in line at the Apple store in Natick, waiting in line for the "second coming".

However, this year had a completely different feeling for me since I already had an iPhone. Being the Apple junkie that I am, I had already watched the entire [WWDC 2008 keynote address](http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/0806wdt546x/event/index.html), so I knew that after Software Update 2.0 was released my "old clunker"; would have many of the same features as the new iPhone 3G.

Software Update 2.0 is stinking amazing! Not taking anything away from new features like Contacts and the ability to save images in an email to your Photo Library, but the App Store and the Apps available for download are just incredible. Apple has made it so easy to browse for new apps, read reviews, and install applications that I truly believe that they are going to have a lock on the cell phone market for years and years to come. Every day it seems I'm installing a new application that blows me away and I can't wait to see what applications and services are released in the next few years.
