Ever since I can remember I've played with Legos. They are such a part of my history and so many others guys that I honestly can't imagine not having Legos around. To this day, I still stop at the Lego section at Walmart to see what new packages they have available. <strong class="highlight">Did I mention that I'm 24 (soon to be 25), looking to get hitched soon, and own my own business?**

No matter how juvenile it seems, Legos will always hold a special place in my heart. Today marks the 50th anniversary of one of the most popular toys ever, and I would be remiss if I let it go by without acknowledging what Legos have meant to me throughout the years. To celebrate, here are a few links to some of my favorite Lego sites as well as pictures of some of the Legos I loved putting together. I hope that you enjoy these as much as I do. **Happy Birthday Lego!**
