Back in 2008, we were in the middle of launching one of our first substantial web design & development projects when.... kaputz, dead, no site to be found. After spending hours on the phone with our hosting provider of that time, cough...**(GoDaddy)**...cough, I about jumped out the window when we hadn't made any progress on getting the site back up. During the next few days we managed to get some the site recovered, but we lost a small amount of our files and had a complete database loss.

We didn't waste time, the next week we began talking with friends and colleagues to find out any helpful info about a reliable hosting company that we could partner with. In the weeks following we tried about a dozen different hosting providers before falling in love with Mosso, which later became known as The Rackspace Cloud in 2009. About 95% of web hosts today provide subpar uptime, well below their advertised 99.9% uptime. To put that into quick perspective think of it this way:

**Downtime Scenario**

<em>If the average uptime with your current host is 99.7% (which it most likely is, maybe even worse to be honest) that rounds out to between 1:30-2:00 hours of downtime. Most hosting providers claim that their average downtime period is less than 5 minutes, so that could leave you with 20 or more periods of downtime in one month! Can you afford to have your website not available 20+ times a month when a prospective client visits? Didn't think so.</em>

### The Epicio Cloud dream-team solution consists of:

- **Rackspace Cloud Servers + Cloud Sites** for Web hosting
- **GoDaddy** for easy and reliable Domain Name Management
- **Rackspace Cloud Files + Akamai** for a Content Delivery Network (CDN)
- **CloudFlare** for DNS acceleration + Content Delivery Network acceleration
- **SendGrid** for a Cloud based email infrastructure

Ever since we made the switch in 2008 we have never been happier. Our comprehensive cloud solution is so easy, fast, and reliable to work with that it increases our productivity when working with both development and production sites. **We have never looked back!** Our hosting uptime sits at 99.99% uptime for our hosting, and Rackspace guarantees 100% uptime for it's network availability.

### So here are two frequent questions we get:

## Question 1: Why do you charge so much for hosting?!

Well, there are many good reasons that we charge considerably more than what you might see advertised online and in TV advertisements nowadays. The companies that offer unlimited everything for $1.99 month are not a company you ever want to trust or rely on. **No company can provide you with unlimited computer resources and storage for $1.99/month, it is simply bad business.** These companies get massive quantity of clients, make money and when it fails and they disappear with your money you'll never get a hold of them or find them. We have made a solid decision to partner with the most reputable companies in the world to provide a higher class of service to all, from the personal blogger to a mid-size corporation. It is because of this decision to provide a world-class solution with the all of the vendors we partner with that increases our cost significantly. We have slashed our profit margin because we believe that a business, school, church of any size deserves the same high-class service that the large scale corporations have.

## Question 2: Why haven't you always advertised your cloud hosting solution?

This is a great question. The answer isn't overly complicated to that and plays into the previous question.
