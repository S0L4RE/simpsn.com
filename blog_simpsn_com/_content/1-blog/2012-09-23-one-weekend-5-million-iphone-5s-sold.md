After the iPhone 5 went on sale this past Friday, Apple has released[initial numbers](http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2012/09/24iPhone-5-First-Weekend-Sales-Top-Five-Million.html) announcing it has sold over **five million** of its new iPhone 5, just three days after its public launch.

If you do some quick math, that is around 20 iPhone 5's sold every second! That is just crazy. Equally as exciting for developers, more than 100 million devices have already been updated with iOS 6 – think about that number for a moment: One Hundred Million. That’s around a quarter of all iOS devices ever sold. When I do the math I make that roughly 242 devices updated to iOS 6 every single second!

It’s a very exciting time in the Apple Developer community but even in the Apple community as a whole. Even if you aren't due for an upgrade or you support Android, take a minute to go check one out to see how light it is! My only beef after playing with it for a few days now is that the edges do seem to nick pretty easy, so make sure you don't put it in your pocket with keys!
