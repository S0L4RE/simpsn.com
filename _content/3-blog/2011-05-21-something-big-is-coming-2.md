After many years of running Epicio from **top-secret, undisclosed remote locations**, we decided to finally bite the bullet and get ourselves our own office space! It took us a few months of looking around, but we’ve set up shop on the top floor of an old building in beautiful downtown Milford, MA. Our office sits perched upon the top floor of the same building that houses [89 Trattoria](http://trattoria89.com/), a local Milford restaurant/bar/landmark.

The easiest way to get to our “penthouse” space is via the main street entrance, which leads to a not-so-quick elevator ride up to the third floor. We have plenty of space for now, beautiful 100 year old granite outer walls, plenty of big windows for sunshine, and 10 foot ceilings that really fit the aesthetic we were looking for. But I know what you’re thinking: <em>“This all sounds great, but do you really need the overhead that comes along with having an office?”</em>.

Stay tuned, we'll be posting more about this soon enough!
