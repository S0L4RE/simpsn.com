A few years ago I was able to change my life for the better when I departed the corporate rat race in 2010 to pursue a full time career in web design and development with a company I started with a friend. I’ve never looked back, and life has been pretty darn good since then.

But let’s not get ahead of ourselves; let me give some background to those who don't know me. I’ve had a long and fruitful relationship with technology which goes right back to my early years – if the number 286 rings a bell you might appreciate this more. I won't take you that far back, but coming out of high school, I knew that technology and I had a future together.

One of the areas I was particularly interested in was the web (design, development, and the infrastructure of how it all works). From creating personal and small business sites in high school, to writing ColdFusion goodness at [Bridgewater State College](http://bridgew.edu), I knew I would always work in the web world.

A few years later, I landed a great job at a small project management software company that allowed me to utilize my passion for design and marketing, and this even eventually spilled into sales. It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, as some designers would put it – and there had come to an end of the amount of design input I was able to give.

In 2008, I met with a colleague of mine and discussed the mutual desire to start a side-project which would provide me with the opportunity to continue sharpening my creative and development skills. Long story short, [Epicio Inc.](http://epicio.com) a Massachusetts design and development firm was born.

In January 2010 I left the software company I worked for to pursue a full-time career with the company I had started, and it has been an incredible journey, and an incredible learning curve; I learned exactly what it takes to run a company, and I forged a large number of great business relationships along the way.

So, why did I leave [Epicio](http://epicio.com) this summer, you ask? I’ve been asked this question many times. After enjoying the adventure and learning experiences at Epicio over the past few years, I came to the point where I wanted to work on bigger and more challenging projects. But because Epicio was outside Boston, and was very small in size, it simply wasn't feasible to fight for the large projects in Boston that I wanted to work on. Since starting at [Hubspot](http://hubspot.com) it has been an incredibly fun and challenging first few months. We have tackled a new home page design for the company user conference, [Inbound 2012](http://inboundconference.com), coming later this month. Stay tuned there is a long list of exciting design projects coming over the following years.

Stay tuned; there is a long list of exciting design projects coming over the following months. I'll be using this blog as a place to write about design principals and my journey in designing and developing for the web.
