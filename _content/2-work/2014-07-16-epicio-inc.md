In 2008, I started a company with a friend and colleague of that time with the intention of creating a business that served the design and development needs of small to medium size companies.We wanted the business to have a very fun and approachable feel so building the brand was barrels of fun. I went with a fun and fresh script type logo and built the website with the same fun and comfortable tones. Over time we expanded to several other services to provide our customers with a one stop shop for all their digital marketing and technology needs.
