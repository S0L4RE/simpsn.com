I believe the world can be a better designed place, and that is what I wake up thinking about every day. Below are some of the projects that I take extra pride in, they were fun to work on and taught me invaluable lessons about building experiences on the web. I have more that i'll be adding so don't forget to check back.

If you want to see more of what Iâ€™m up to, you can look at my design work-in-progress on Dribbble, and you can scour my code on [GitHub](http://github.com/simpson).
